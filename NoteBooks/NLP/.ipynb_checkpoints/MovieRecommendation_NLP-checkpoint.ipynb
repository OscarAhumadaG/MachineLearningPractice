Fearing trouble, his mother takes him to a saint in Thiruvannamalai. The Swami resembles Easwaran. A sequence of events forces them to swap places.

They try to keep Uncle Cedric from working, because he will ruin the company. Troubles start when he hires schemer Joe as his personal assistant. He later also hires Minnie, a woman who has a great passion for fashion. When he buys the dress shop for Minnie where Colleen works as a bookkeeper, a scandal is soon followed. Donald decides to shut the shop, but is stopped because of his infatuation towards Colleen. It is Colleen who eventually makes a profit out of the things that happened. Meanwhile, a man named Cedric tries to adopt Minnie. Minnie refuses and thereby causes a scandal. This angers Alicia, but the press can't get enough of it. Donald loses Colleen's affection and thus is sued by Joe.\",\n          \"The film is narrated by Charlotte Flax, a quirky and awkward 15-year-old girl living in Oklahoma with her single, eccentric mother, Rachel (whom she calls \\\"Mrs. Flax\\\"), and her sweet nine-year-old sister, Kate. Rachel's daughters have different fathers\\u2014Charlotte is a product of a teenage romance and Kate is from an affair with an athlete.\\r\\nThe narration begins in early fall of 1963. Just as Rachel's latest fling with her married employer ends, she decides to relocate with Charlotte and Kate once again. This time, they move to a new home near a convent in the small town of Eastport, Massachusetts. Charlotte has an unusual obsession with Catholicism, strengthened by her mother's disapproval, and idolizes the nuns living in the convent. Kate, on the other hand, loves all things swimming and is an avid competitor, apparently getting it from Rachel's Olympic one night stand from which she was conceived.\\r\\nIn Eastport, Charlotte becomes especially interested in Joe Poretti, the 26-year-old handsome caretaker of the convent and local school bus driver, while Rachel falls in love with a local shop owner named Lou Landsky. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Charlotte finds Joe ringing the convent bell and consoles him. However, they begin to kiss and feeling filled with sin she flees. After the encounter, she begins fasting in order to purge her sinful thoughts, but eventually passes out from hunger and the fear of immaculate conception and starts eating again.\\r\\nSoon fearing that God may be punishing through pregnancy and unable to talk to her mother about it, she steals her car and runs away. She stops at the house of a \\\"perfect nuclear family\\\" in New Haven, Connecticut, asking to spend the night, telling them her name is Sal Val and other wild stories, which they don't seem to completely believe. Later on, she is picked up by Lou and taken home after the family reports her, where Charlotte immediately receives a harsh scolding from Rachel believing she could have been murdered.\\r\\nWhen Rachel calms down, she tells Charlotte that she was worried sick about her safety, and, thinking that it's her fault that Charlotte ran away from home, admits that even though she's not an expert in parenting, she's willing to compromise and try her best to take care of both Charlotte and Kate. The next day, Charlotte makes an appointment at the nearest clinic under the name Joan Arc, where she sees an obstetrician and is told she is still a virgin and therefore cannot be pregnant. Relieved, she goes home, dispelled of her assumption that \\\"one kiss can get you pregnant\\\".\\r\\nAt a New Year's Eve costume party sometime after a large fight with Lou, he asks Rachel to marry/move in with him but she declines both, reminding him that he's still married. However, she's not willing to break up with him nor let their relationship progress either. This ends with Lou calmly leaving in disappointment. Rachel then asks Joe for a ride home, before she wishes him a happy New Year and kisses him. Charlotte sees this and feels that her mother is trying to steal him away.\\r\\nThe night after the incident, Charlotte dresses up in Rachel's clothes and makeup in an attempt to show that she can be just as appealing as her mother. She and Kate get drunk on wine and talk on the porch about Kate's birth. Hearing the church bells ringing, Charlotte then takes Kate to the convent and tells her that she'll be back. Kate decides to drunkenly collect rocks while Charlotte goes up to the bell tower to find Joe, where they have sex. Unbeknownst to them, Kate falls into a river and almost drowns due to her inebriation, but is saved by the nuns and is taken to the hospital.\\r\\nOutraged at the turn of events, Rachel and Charlotte argue, eventually leading to an understanding of each other as mother and daughter and not just friends. Charlotte convinces Rachel to stay in Eastport for at least another year.\\r\\nTime passes in the small town and Rachel's relationship with Lou continues. Joe moves to California and opens up a plant nursery, but keeps in touch with Charlotte via postcards. Charlotte, in turn, gains a reputation in high school due to her sexual encounter with Joe and replaces her Catholicism obsession with Greek mythology and a less conservative look; Rachel now reminding her that they are not Greek. Kate has recovered and is swimming again, although the accident left her hearing sometimes \\\"sounding fuzzy\\\". The film ends with all three of them dancing while setting the table for dinner.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

led by hern\\u00e1n cort\\u00e9s for the new world. during the voyage, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but break free and take a rowboat with the help of cort\\u00e9s' horse, altivo.\\r\\nthey reach an unknown shore at the edge of mexico, where miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a waterfall that tulio believes is a dead end. as they prepare to leave, they encounter a native woman, chel, being chased by guards. when the guards see tulio and miguel riding altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them and chel to a secret entrance behind the falls, into el dorado. they are brought to the city's elders, kindhearted chief tannabok and wicked high priest tzekel-kan. the pair are mistaken for gods and given luxurious quarters, along with the charge of chel. chel discovers the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. the two are showered with gifts of gold from tannabok, but disapprove of tzekel-kan attempting to sacrifice a civilian as the gods' ritual.\\r\\ntulio instructs tannabok to build them a boat so that they can leave the city with all the gifts they have been given. during the three days this will take, miguel explores the city, and chel gets romantically close to tulio. miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life the citizens seem to enjoy. when tzekel-kan sees miguel playing a ball game with children, he insists the gods demonstrate their powers against the city's best players in the same game. tulio and miguel are far outmatched, but chel is able to substitute the ball with an armadillo, allowing them to win. miguel spares the ritual of sacrificing the losing team and chastises tzekel-kan, much to the crowd's approval. tzekel-kan notices miguel received a small cut and realizes the two are not gods, because gods do not bleed. tzekel-kan conjures a giant stone jaguar to chase them through the city. tulio and miguel outwit the jaguar, causing it and tzekel-kan to fall into a giant whirlpool, thought to be the entrance to xibalba. tzekel-kan then surfaces in the jungle, where he encounters cort\\u00e9s and his men. thinking cort\\u00e9s is a god, he offers to lead them to el dorado.\\r\\nwith the boat completed, miguel says he will stay in the city. as tulio and chel board the boat, they see smoke on the horizon and realize cort\\u00e9s is close. tulio suggests using the boat to ram rock pillars under the waterfall and block the main entrance to the city. the plan succeeds with the citizens pulling over a statue in the boat's wake to give it enough speed. as the statue starts to fall too quickly, tulio has difficulty in preparing the boat's sail. giving up on staying in the city, miguel and altivo jump onto the boat to unfurl the sails, assuring the boat clears the statue in time. the group successfully crashes against the pillars, causing a cave-in but losing all their gifts in the process. they hide near the totem, just as cort\\u00e9s' men and tzekel-kan arrive. when tzekel-kan finds the entrance blocked, cort\\u00e9s brands him a liar, and takes tzekel-kan prisoner as they leave.\\r\\ntulio and miguel, though disappointed they lost the gold (unaware that altivo still wears the golden horseshoes with which he was outfitted in el dorado), head in a

horror one night at camp blackfoot, several campers pull a prank on the caretaker named cropsy by setting a worm-riddled skull next to his bed with candles in the eye sockets. when the caretaker is awoken by the campers banging on his window, he is frightened by the skull and accidentally knocks it onto his bed, starting a fire. the flames reach to a gas tank, where it ignites cropsy and his cabin. he runs outside, engulfed in flames, and stumbles down into a river as the boys flee from the scene.\\r\\nfive years later, cropsy is released from the hospital despite having to deal with failed skin grafts, and wears a coat and hat to hide his deformities. while outside, a prostitute lures him, and in a fit of rage, he repeatedly stabs her with a pair of scissors. soon, he arms himself with a pair of garden shears and sets out to another summer camp entitled camp stonewater. at the camp, the counselors and campers are playing baseball and tiger, one of the campers, goes to search for the baseball lost in the woods. tiger finds the ball and runs back to the game just before cropsy almost attacks her.\\r\\nthe next morning, a camper named alfred scares sally as she steps out of the shower. sally's screams bring the counselors michelle and todd to the scene, and campers karen and eddy catch alfred. michelle is furious at alfred's actions and demands that he leaves, but todd talks to him; he finds out that alfred has no friends, and was merely pulling a prank on sally. later, sally's boyfriend glazer confronts alfred, but todd gets him to back off, and alfred apologizes to sally. that night, alfred spots cropsy outside his window, but nobody believes him.\\r\\nthe next day, todd, michelle, and the kids all go on a canoe trip down to the river devil's creek, and todd tells the campers about the legend of cropsy. after the campfire, karen and eddy go to a lake to skinny dip. eddy is upset when karen reconsiders having sex with him, and leaves the lake to get her clothes. as she collects them, cropsy grabs her and slashes her throat with his shears. the next morning, michelle finds out about karen's disappearance and the missing canoes. while she and todd question eddy, the campers fish, woodstock, marine, and barbara search for the canoes on a makeshift raft. they spot a canoe and paddle to it, and are ambushed by cropsy, who jumps out from the canoe and savagely kills them all with his shears.\\r\\nearly the next morning, glazer has sex with sally in the woods, but suffers premature ejaculation. after this, he goes to get matches to start a campfire and resume their intimacy. while away, cropsy appears and forcibly shoves his shears into sally's chest, and a returned glazer is stabbed through the neck and pinned to a tree by cropsy. alfred witnesses this and wakes up todd, who comes along with him. while investigating his body, todd is knocked unconscious by cropsy and he chases after alfred.\\r\\nwhile michelle discovers the slaughtered camper's bodies on the makeshift raft and brings the remaining campers - dave, tiger, diane, sophie, alan, and rhonda - back to camp to contact the police, todd reawakens and chases after cropsy with an axe. cropsy takes alfred hostage inside an abandoned mineshaft, and pins him to a wall with his shears before arming himself with a flamethrower-esque blowtorch. after finding karen's body in the mineshaft, todd sees cropsy and remembers he was one of the campers behind the prank that disfigured him. cropsy appears, showing his disfigurement, and fights off todd just before alfred frees himself and stabs him in the back with his own shears. he reappears and is killed by todd when he slams the axe into his face, and alfred ignites him once again. they make their way outside to michelle, who has brought the police via helicopter, and cropsy's corpse continues to burn away.\\r\\nthe film ends with another group of teenagers retelling the story of cropsy around a
